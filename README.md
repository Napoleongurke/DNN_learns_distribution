# DNN_learns_distribution

Re-produce the toy study about the reconstruction of Xmax distributions.

Install the requirements via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the file "DNN_learns_distribution.py".

Feel free to change the NOISE paramter

Note the training will run significantly faster on a GPU or an dedicated CPU.


If you have a GPU don't forget to activate it using:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```
